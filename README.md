# Google Java Style Guide Exercises

## Find bad code passages
Parts of the code in this project violates the rules defined in the Google Java Style Guide. Each source code file deals with specific section of the Style Guide. Find and correct these code-sections without the use of the CheckStyle plugin.
There are 3 errors in each file.

* FileStructure.java -> https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s3-source-file-structure
* Formatting.java -> https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4-formatting
* Naming.java -> https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5-naming
* Javadoc.java -> https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7-javadoc

## Get help from a linter
After searching for (and hopefully finding) all errors, install / activate the Checkstyle plugin and make sure that you found the correct passages.
